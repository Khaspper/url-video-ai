Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are pushing for significant federal spending cuts through their advisory council, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). During their visit to Congress, they met with Republican lawmakers to advocate for a smaller government and reduced regulations. However, achieving Musk's goal of cutting $2 trillion in federal spending is challenging due to mandatory spending obligations like Social Security and Medicare, which are politically sensitive to alter. The discretionary budget, which includes defense spending, offers limited room for cuts. Some Republicans are open to reforms, such as work requirements for Medicaid, but significant reductions remain difficult without affecting national security. The idea of requiring federal employees to return to office work is gaining traction as a cost-cutting measure, though it faces opposition from unions. The discussions are ongoing, with no immediate consensus reached.
