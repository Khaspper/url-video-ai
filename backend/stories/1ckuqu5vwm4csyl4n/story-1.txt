The GitHub repository 'image-generation' by gptscript-ai is a tool designed to generate images based on specified parameters. It provides a list of URLs to the generated images. The repository includes examples like 'artist.gpt', where an artist inspired by impressionist and pointillism styles creates a new painting, and 'lion.gpt', where an expert generates an image of a lion in the savannah.
