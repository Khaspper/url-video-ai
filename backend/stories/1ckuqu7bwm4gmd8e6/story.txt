Jay-Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, has been accused in a civil lawsuit of raping a 13-year-old girl in 2000, alongside Sean "Diddy" Combs. The accuser, known as "Jane Doe," claims the assault occurred after being taken to an MTV Video Music Awards after-party. The lawsuit, initially filed in October, was refiled to include Carter. Jay-Z has dismissed the allegations as "idiotic" and urged for a criminal complaint instead of a civil one. Combs' legal team has labeled the lawsuits as "shameless publicity stunts." Combs is currently facing criminal charges for racketeering and sex trafficking. The accuser is seeking unspecified damages under New York's Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Act. Jay-Z expressed concern for his family's privacy amidst the allegations.
